## Get Started

### Install tiged

To clone this repository, devoid of `.git`, you can either use `npx
degit` or install `tiged` locally and run `degit` without `npx`.
YMMV.

[Tiged is a fork that addresses a number of
issues](https://github.com/tiged/tiged#why-fork=), and should be preferred. To
install it, run:

```bash
npm uninstall -g degit
npm install -g tiged
```

Most likely, `npx degit` would invoke `degit`. A locally installed
binary makes sure you are running `tiged` instead.

### Peruse the template

1. Clone the template:
   1. using npx: `npx degit gacallea/elm_vite_tailwind_template my-elm-app`
   2. local binary: `degit gacallea/elm_vite_tailwind_template my-elm-app`
2. Enter the project: `cd my-elm-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start developing: `npm run dev`

## Contributing

Contributions and constructive criticism are welcome. If you think I'm
overdoing it, feel free to discuss. I'm still experimenting with this, as a
learning opportunity, and I strive to improve the template as much as possible.

### pre-commit hooks (WIP)

This repo relies on [pre-commit-ci](https://pre-commit.ci) to make sure all
suggested coding standards are enforced with [git
hooks](https://githooks.com/). You could also install
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) locally to apply the same
[configuration](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) locally.
